# COVID - 19 Data Science Project	



This repository is an ongoing COVID - 19 data science project, containing 3 models to predict the spread of COVID, and a data visualization of state COVID trends.

### Models	


- **LSTM:** An LSTM Neural Network model was used to predict global COVID cases.	


- **SIR:** An SIR Epidemic Model was used to predict the number of people that get infected with or recover from COVID in 10 countries with the highest COVID cases.	


- **Gaussian:** A Gaussian Error Function was used to predict US COVID deaths.	



### Visualizations	


- **State Visualizations:** Data Visualizations of COVID trends in US States
